Compromises
===========
RESTful services should not keep state. This means the server should not track 
sessions. However, to improve performance we have decided to use a session 
tracking cookie. This is because #define is using an external authentication 
service, specifically a Logica Active Domain server. Calling the authentication
service on every single request is quite costly, hence the session tracking 
cookie. In short, to improve the performance of your client and decrease the 
strain on #define, please use the ``define-session`` cookie sent by the server 
after the initial authentication.

Data Formats
============
Dates: Use `ISO 8601`_ with timezone, ``YYYY-MM-DD(THH:MM:SS.uuuu(Z|+00(:00)))``, 
eg ``2009-05-04T13:37:01Z``. Timezone may be omitted when there is no time given.

Errors
======
Status code ``400`` (Bad Request) is used whenever there are errors in the input.
Any error details are reported in the response body. Error ``500`` indicates an
error on the server side, and should be regarded as a bug (please report any ``500`` 
responses to the `#define support`_).

Authentication Process
----------------------

To allow your service to act 'on behalf' of end-users when using the
#define REST API, you will send a client SSL certificate as part of
your HTTP request. This certificate will authenticate your
service. Inside the HTTP request you will provide an HTTP BASIC
authorisation header which includes the username that you are 'acting
on behalf of'. You do not need to send the password of the user.

Note the matching of the username is Case Sensitive. For example, you
need to send "GROUPINFRA", not "groupinfra".

To arrange your API Partner x509 certificate please request via
support@define.nu and state:

 * API Partner Name
 * API Partner administration email address
 * Public website URL
 * Description of your service
 * Which permissions you require (ORDER_VIEW, ACCOUNT_VIEW, etc.)
 * Which format you require for your x509 certificate (PEM or pkcs12)

Authorization Process
---------------------

The accounts/projects who wish to use your services then needs to
visit the API settings page on their account or project.

They will select which permissions (of those you requested to be
available) apply to the specific account/project.

Example to check your certificate
---------------------------------

You can use the 'curl' command to verify your access is working as you
expect.

Provide the email address of the user to impersonate (no password
needed), and the certificate which #define service management provided
to you.
